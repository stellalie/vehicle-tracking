## Thingosity Coordinates

###To launch:
cd www
php -S localhost:8080

## Future enhancement:

### Core functionality:

    * Being able to view data per device grouped by timestamp, ie. for this point of time I want to be able to view my coordinates, and other data (ie. machine rpm, etc)
      So I can show them on the map as infoWindows
    * Handle realtime updates

### Handle multiple devices-itemkeys better (need spec)

    * Add delete device button
    * Disallow multiple items to be added the same time
    * Coordinates view shall be `tabbed` upon multiple itemkeys
    
### Access:

    * User management and login form
    * API security keys, only allow accessing data if user has access on
    * Registration form
    
### ???:

    * UI wise need to be designed (Get stanley input)
